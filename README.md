Simple website to practice the basics of HTML.
The site consists of an index page that links to each of the three recipes. In the recipes pages, there is a header with the meal's name, a picture of the meal, a brief description, a link to the original webpage where the recipe was found, a list of ingredients, and a list of the steps needed to cook the meal. At the top of the page there is a link to return to the index page.

Concepts put into practice:
1. The use of header tags for appropriate header size.
2. The use of paragraph tags for correct line-breaks.
3. The use of anchor tags for absolute and relative links.
4. The use of image tags for image display.
5. The use of list tags for list display.
