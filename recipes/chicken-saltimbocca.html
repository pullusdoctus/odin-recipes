    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 to 8 sage leaves, or as needed</li>
      <li>3 thin slices prosciutto</li>
      <li>2 tbsps. olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tbsps. Marsala wine or white wine</li>
      <li>1/2 juiced lemon</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tbsps. cold unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 lemon wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch thickness. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
      <li>With the smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage leaves on each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger sage flavor. Then, cover breasts with a single layer of prosciutto, covering the sage underneath.</li>
      <li>Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking for best results.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken, prosciutto-side down. in the pan, and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. Exact time will depend on size and thickness of chicken breasts.</li>
      <li>Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and cover loosely with foil.</li>
      <li>For the sauce, add Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and place back over medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and swirl in butter until it disappears.</li>
      <li>Spoon sauce generously over chicken saltimbocca and add a lemon wedge on the side.</li>
    </ol>
