      <li> 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. ground cumin</li>

      <li>3 pounds chicken wing drumettes</li>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place yellow onion, habanero peppers, green onions, lime juice, soy sauce, garlic, fresh thyme, brown sugar, oil, salt, black pepper, allspice, dried thyme, cinnamon, cumin, and nutmeg into a blender. Blend until marinade is completely smooth.</li>
      <li>Place chicken drumettes into a large bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and toss to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 F째 (230 C째). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Arrange chicken evenly on the prepared baking sheet; reserve marinade in the bowl.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the reserved marinade onto chicken, then turn over. Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn chicken over and brush with remaining reserved marinade. Continue baking until tender and caramelized, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 F째 (74째 C). Rest chicken on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a serving platter.</li>
